                "Baldwin is a true literary stylist—sharp, enigmatic, witty, and brutally honest. He writes
                like the best jazz-music moves: rhythmic, elegant but angular, with some spellbinding staccato.
                No nonsense."
                <br /><br />
                "Right now we need James Baldwin and his surgical insight to tell us how it is without boring
                us to death. To remind us to remain calm in the face of despair, to face forces that seem way
                out of our control with dignity, to cry if we have to and then to keep going. More than anything
                else, we need his sense of style."

                "When we began to dialogue with US artists working with new technologies, we were also
                perplexed by the fact that when referring to 'cyber-space' or 'the net', they spoke of
                a politically neutral/race-less/gender-less and classless 'territory' which provided us
                all with 'equal access', and unlimited possibilities of participation, interaction and
                belonging, specially 'belonging' (in a time in which no one feels that they 'belong'
                anywhere). Yet there was never any mention of the physical and social loneliness, or the
                fear of the 'real world' which propels so many people to get on line, stay 'there' and
                pretend they are having 'meaningful' experiences of 'communication' or 'discovery' (two
                very American obsessions). To many of them, the thought of exchanging identities in the
                net and impersonating other genders, races or ages, without real (social or physical)
                consecuences seemed extremely appealing and liberating, and by no means, superficial or
                escapist.
                <br /><br />
                The utopian rhetoric around digital technologies, specially the one coming out of California,
                reminded Roberto and I of a sanitized version of the pioneer and frontier mentalities of the
                Old West, and also the early century futurist cult to the speed, size and beauty of epic
                technologies(airplanes, trains, factories, etc.) Given the existing compassion fatigue
                regarding political art and art dealing with matters of race and gender, it was hard not
                to see this feel-good phylosophy (or rather theosophy) as an attractive exit from the
                acute social and racial crisis afflicting the U.S."

                faux-artisanal aesthetic. Digital platforms like Foursquare are producing 'a harmonization of tastes' across the

                    "What Strength Really Means When You’re Sick"
                </a> &mdash; Ed Yong, <i>The Atlantic</i>
                </b><br />
                "Equating disease with warfare, and recovery with strength, means that death and disability are linked to failure and weakness...Like
                so much else about the pandemic, the strength-centered rhetoric confuses more than it clarifies, and reveals more about
                America’s values than the disease currently plaguing it."
                <br /><br />
                "'[President Theodore Roosevelt's] effort to overcome the weakness of his youth instantiated itself through colonialism,' says Zoë Wool, a medical anthropologist
                at the University of Toronto. 'He demonstrated strength through the claiming of nature in the name of the nation.'"
                <br /><br />
                "In recent years, the ideologies of eugenics, where 'if you’re sick, it’s your own fault and you don’t deserve support, [have] become
                more and more blatant,' says Pamela Block, an anthropologist at Western University. As the pandemic progressed, many saw the deaths of
                elderly people, or those with preexisting conditions, as acceptable and dismissible. And as COVID-19 disproportionately hit Black,
                Latino, Indigenous, and Pacific Islander communities, 'people who believed in the idea of white supremacy felt like the virus was
                doing their work for them, and could promote the idea that they’re genetically stronger...'"
                <br /><br />
                "Trump is hardly the first American to mischaracterize his own privilege as fortitude, but from his lips, that error is uniquely and
                doubly pernicious. It distracts not only from the massive advantages that he enjoys, but also from his singular role in America’s pandemic year."

                "...the intentional traveler, wrapped up in the space of [their] own deliberations, is, by the same token, absent

                [one’s] perception—that is, by an ever-vigilant monitoring of the path as it unfolds. Simply put, you have to

                <br /><br />
                "That campaign was about a demarcation of time. So it’s interesting, and certainly troubling, to read the decline
                in labor unions in the last several decades alongside a similar decline in the demarcation of public space.
                True public spaces, the most obvious examples being parks and libraries, are places for — and thus the spatial
                underpinnings of — 'what we will.'"
                <br /><br />
                "In a public space, ideally, you are a citizen with agency; in a faux public space, you are either a consumer

                involves a difficult, awkward, ambiguous encounter between two differently shaped bodies that are themselves
                ambiguous — and this meeting, this sensing, requires and takes place in time. Not only that, due to the effort
                of sensing, the two entities might come away from the encounter a bit differently than they went in."

                    "A Year of Miseducation"
                </a> &mdash; Matt Thompson, <i>The Atlantic</i>
                </b><br />
                "Every person has two choices for how to cope with any aspect of society that is uncomfortable: act
                to change it, or surrender. Miseducation is the art of teaching people to surrender."
                <br /><br />
                "The aftermath of that trauma, of being taught to diminish one’s own self-worth, to question one’s very
                right to take up space in the world, can engulf entire lives. Given the booster shot of a school or
                education system, it can swallow whole communities. This makes miseducation so enticing as a means of
                social control that it recurs again and again, in an endless variety of contexts."
                <br /><br />
                "The children’s native tongues were clipped from them, their hair was ripped from them, their clothes
                were stripped from them, and they were sent to live in the white culture, in hopes that they would
                find white tongues and hair and clothes. In many cases, they did not. 'As a result,' the report found,
                'many return to the reservations disillusioned,' bereft of the great asset of their cultures. ¶ <i>Grandma,
                    I don’t understand you</i>, they would say. And their grandmothers would respond, <i>Then who are you?</i>{` `}
                ¶ Never forget that a school can be a curse."
                <br /><br />
                "In <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i>, the artist expounds gorgeously on the hard-won knowledge she earned
                on her ascent to the height of the music industry and into motherhood—lessons on love and money, fame and
                family, power and principles. Twenty years later, as Hill toured with these songs in 2018, the album still
                felt like a message out of time, as resonant as it ever was, despite the fact that Hill was just beginning
                her 20s when she made it. In the confidence of her flow, the lavish rasp of her alto, the iconic,
                unmistakable production choices, she sounds impossibly wise, wiser than most grown-ups could ever hope to be."
                <br /><br />
                "In the late ’90s, when <i>Miseducation</i> was recorded, Ras Baraka was an activist and educator in an occupied
                school district. The state of New Jersey had recently taken over control of Newark public schools. That was
                still the case in 2010, when Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg gave Newark $100 million to transform its
                education system. The gift, as Dale Russakoff recounts in her definitive book, The Prize, reflected a grand
                bargain between Zuckerberg and Chan, Newark’s then-mayor Cory Booker, and New Jersey’s then-governor Chris
                Christie. The three parties sought to demonstrate that with the right leadership, empowered by the state
                to put in place new, proven approaches to education, Newark’s schools could become a model for cities
                around the country in only five years. That aim, Russakoff argued, helped to doom the popularity of the
                group’s reforms among residents. 'The language of national models,' she wrote, 'left little room for
                attention to the unique problems of Newark, its schools, or its children.'"
                <br /><br />
                "If a school is devised purely as an escape route to a different world, he believed, then it will teach
                students only the information required to exist in that other world. The students will emerge knowing
                nothing about their environment except why and how to leave it, leaving them incapable of understanding
                it, much less improving it."
                <br /><br />
                "'If you understood who you are,' Ras Baraka once said, 'you would understand that the world belongs to
                you. And you shouldn’t claim a piece of it, you should claim all of it. And when you begin to claim all
                of it, you fight for the whole of humanity.'"
